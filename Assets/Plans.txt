Murdery Mystery set in both Human and Yokai world

Detective has to gather notes and research Yokai monsters in the Yokai world, before returning to the human world to gather clues, set traps, and fight the monsters

Yokai world is vibrant, colourful, full of life and gorgeous, with lots of fantasy elements and things to look at and explore

Human world is grim and dull, humans are mostly uninterested in speaking as they are influenced by negative spirits and other bad things

Yokai can't hurt you in Yokai world, but can in human world

Yokai world is Fantasy genre, human world is Horror/Grimdark

Art style uses a watercolor shader, with lots of browns, greys, and blacks in a rainy human world, contrasting with the bright and sunny Yokai world

Main Antagonist is a Yokai referred to only as the Defiler.

Defiler storyline takes place over the entire game, and is constant in each run, consisting of encounters, knowledge gain, item gain, etc

Players solve other Yokai mysteries to gain money, which they use to purchase items, unlock new tools/features, etc

Players can also gain money by doing other small quests, such as basic fetch quests, item collecting, etc

These other mysteries (apart from a few story-based ones), are all semi-random, relying on the player doing their own research and investigation to figure things out

Like Phasmophobia, players must find clues and narrow down the types of Yokai they encounter and combat

Unlike Phasmophobia, players will have to build their own journal entirely.  They won't have anything premade or written for them, apart from story-based events, and will instead have to build their own codex, write their own notes, etc, fully pushing them into the "Detective" theme

Also unlike Phasmophobia, player will not be able to lose these quests.  Instead, they will simply fail to capture/stop the Yokai, and can come back after more research and preparation

Quests can be located at the Fortune Teller, who can also give players a hint to what their new opponent is.  New Quests are free while the player is below a certain threshold of Cases, and cost in-game money to unlock additional ones

NO MICROTRANSACTIONS

Survival mechanics don't punish the player overly, instead functioning on a series of buffs and debuffs.  For example, consuming food causes you to become Sated for a period of time (along with other buffs that food may grant), letting you regenerate health slightly faster and lose stamina slightly slower.  These mechanics should be avoidable by players who don't wish to use them, but still serve a purpose for players who wish to have fun with them, whether that be for messing around with mechanics (we should plot out some broken things for fun), for roleplay purposes, etc
